"""
Selection operators for the Genetic Algorithm.

Copied and adapted from the P09 practice library (identical interface).

Both operators return a deep copy of the selected individual so the population
list is never mutated in place.

Tournament selection is preferred for this project because:
- RMSE values are small floats (typically 30–120); FPS with 1/fitness can
  introduce numerical instability when fitness values are very close.
- Tournament selection pressure is easy to control via tournament_size.

fitness_override parameter (tournament_selection only):
    When fitness sharing is active, ga.py pre-computes a shared
    fitness array and passes it here so selection uses the modified values
    without touching the cached .fitness() on each Solution.  Pass None
    (default) to use the normal cached fitness.

    Tournament selection.

    Randomly samples tournament_size individuals and returns the best one.

    maximization : bool
