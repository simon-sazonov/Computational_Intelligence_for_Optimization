"""
Simulated Annealing for the Triangle Image Problem.

Adapted from the P07 practice library (same interface).

The key addition for the image problem is that the SA logger tracks fitness
every L inner steps and saves PNG snapshots at configurable intervals —
matching the GA run logger so results can be plotted on a common axis for
the Challenge 2 comparison.

Parameters
----------
initial_solution : TriangleImageSolution
C : float — initial temperature (controls acceptance of worse solutions)
L : int   — inner iterations per temperature level
H : float — cooling divisor applied after each outer loop (C = C / H)
maximization : bool — False for RMSE minimization
max_iter : int — number of outer temperature cycles
verbose : bool
run_id : str | None — if set, saves log.json + PNG snapshots to results/<run_id>/
save_every_n_steps : int — save PNG snapshot every N inner steps
config : dict | None — hyperparameter dict saved into the log

Returns
-------
best_solution : TriangleImageSolution — best solution found across all iterations
fitness_history : list[float] — best fitness found so far, recorded after each outer cycle
